# TSX React hook typical uses repository - To learn them well

Many examples of use of the hooks, so I can interiorize them.
Each one in a different component.

## ðŸŒŸVITE

- To create a project:

- [x] run: `npm create vite@latest`

select 'React' as the framework and select 'Javascript' as the variant.

- [x] run: `npm install` to install all the dependencies

---

- To run the project:

- [x] run: `npm run dev`

---

## ðŸŒŸTAILWIND

Go to the frameworks guides. [In this case for Vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite)

- [x] `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`

- [x] `npx tailwindcss init -p`

To generate a TypeScript config file, use the --ts flag:

- [x] `npx tailwindcss init --ts`

ðŸ’¡ Generate a complete configuration file that includes all of Tailwindâ€™s default configuration:

- [x] `npx tailwindcss init --full`

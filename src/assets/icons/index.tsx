import truck from "./truck-fast.svg";
import support from "./support.svg";
import shield from "./shield-tick.svg";

export { truck, support, shield };

//The use of {} in the export statement is a shortcut for exporting multiple variables, functions, or objects. It allows you to list the items you want to export within the curly braces {} without having to explicitly define each export separately.

// This would be the other option: Exporting variables individually:

// export const truck = 'truck';
// export const support = 'support';
// export const shield = 'shield';
